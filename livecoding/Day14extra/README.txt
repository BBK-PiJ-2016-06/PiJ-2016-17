Dear student, 

The attached ZIP file contains an explained solution to Exercise 2 of Week 14: the recursive anagram. This is intended as additional help for those of you that find this exercise particularly challenging. The password is fidelio, as in a well-known film by a well-known director. 

Use responsibly. Remember that just reading the solution without having made a fair effort at the exercise will give you a comforting yet probably misleading feeling of having understood, and that human being learn more from their errors. 

Hope this helps, 

Sergio
